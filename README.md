# nifHdada2
This is a nifH database formated for dada2. 

The database is based on the ARB nifH database from the Zehr Lab (Heller 2014), which was reformatted, modified, and updated. 
A log of modifications made between the nifH June 2017 ARB file and this database can be found in this repository (link).Modifications were based on information available on NCBI. 

# Database generation
Modifications were made directly in an XML file exported from ARB (link).

The fasta formatted database for dada2 was generated from the modified XML file. The script for parsing data and generating the fasta file is included in this repository (link).
